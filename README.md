Suggestive Contours GPU Implementation


 - More info on: http://www.forceflow.be/thesis/thesis-code/
 - Requirements: Support for fragment/pixel shaders, Trimesh2 library.

I'm working on a more modern version of this viewer in src/sc_viewer - very WIP. The old, legacy OpenGL version should still compile, though, and can be used in the meantime
